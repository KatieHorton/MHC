MENTAL HEALTH CONNECT


I Loved learing to build an API from scratch in class.  JavaScript is my jam.

Mental Health Connect is created with the goal of improving communication and awareness of mental health issues in the community.  The CRUD routes are functioning. Users can search for, review, and request information from providers.  This app will require authentication, still a work in progress.  I also plan to add some design and make things look pretty.  I have a goal of improving organiztion of all my projects as well.
